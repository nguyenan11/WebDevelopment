# Web Development

This repo contains small web applications/ projects that might be included in my CV/ personal web.

## Personal Website

*Message*: This is the old [version](https://nguyenan11.github.io/web-development/personal-web/) where I first started out.
An improved version is available in the a separate [personal-website](https://github.com/nguyenan11/personal-website) repo

The contents uploaded here are not particularly meaningful, professional 
(at least not yet). It was meant to show my progress by starting everything from 
scratch and also helps me practice with HTML/ CSS/ Bootstrap before diving in 
depth into JavaScript.

## Expense tracking application

There are 2 dices, 1 for each player. Upon hitting the roll button, dices will 
be rolled into random results, winner or draw will be announced.

the sequence.
