# Web Development

This repo contains small web applications/ projects that will be included in my CV/ personal web.

## Personal Website

*Message*: This is the old [version](https://nguyenan11.github.io/WebDevelopment/personalWeb/) where I first started out.
An improved version is available in the a separate [personal-website](https://github.com/nguyenan11/personal-website) repo

The contents uploaded here are not particularly meaningful, professional 
(at least not yet). It means to show my progress by starting everything from 
scratch and also helps me practice with HTML/ CSS/ Bootstrap before diving in 
depth into JavaScript.

## Rolling dices game
* Plain JavaScript

Simple 2 players [game](https://nguyenan11.github.io/WebDevelopment/rollingDiceGame/dice.html)

There are 2 dices, 1 for each player. Upon hitting the roll button, dices will 
be rolled into random results, winner or draw will be announced.

## Simon game
* JavaScript and jQuery

The famous Simon [game](https://nguyenan11.github.io/WebDevelopment/simonGame/)

The platform creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat 
the sequence.
