Though it said CV, the contents uploaded here are not particularly meaningful,
professional (at least not yet). It means to show my progress by starting 
everything from scratch and also helps me practice with HTML/ CSS/ Bootstrap 
before diving in depth into JavaScript.

# Dice game

Simple 2 players [game](https://nguyenan11.github.io/cv/rollingDiceGame/dice.html)

There are 2 dices, 1 for each player. Upon refresh, dices will be rolled into
random results, winner or draw will be determined.
