There are 2 dices, 1 for each player. Upon hitting the roll button, dices will be rolled into random results, winner or draw will be announced.

## Simon game
* JavaScript and jQuery

The famous Simon [game](https://nguyenan11.github.io/web-development/simon-game/)

The platform creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat 
the sequence.

## Personal Website

*Message*: This is the old [version](https://nguyenan11.github.io/web-development/personal-web/) where I first started out. The contents uploaded here are not particularly meaningful, professional. It was meant to show my progress by starting everything from 
scratch and also helps me to practice with HTML/ CSS/ Bootstrap before diving in depth into JavaScript.
Please refer to an improved, readily version at a separate [personal-website](https://github.com/nguyenan11/personal-website) repo
